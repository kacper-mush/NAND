# NAND Library
This library provides the user with a NAND gate structure and many operations on it. The key characteristics of the gates are: 
- variable amount of inputs,
- variable amount of outputs,
- critical path calculation,
- complex evaluation.

The user can create complex systems using these gates by linking them together, setting up boolean signals for them, and more.
The repository contains an usage example with a makefile that helps with compiling the library and linking it.
